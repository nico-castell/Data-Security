This repositoriy is a ***show*** of some programs and data security
algorithms I made. It's meant to be used in
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and on
**Linux**. However, you should me able to compile almost everything with a
few tweaks to the [config files](.vscode) on any other platforms.

    information is available on that project's README.

## How to use the workspace

There are some build and debug tasks already prepared, as well as a
[makefile](makefile) to quickly compile and run the different projects.

1. **Build tasks:** There are 6 build tasks prepared, 4 to compile each
    project individually, 1 to compile through the the makefile, and 1
    to clean through the makefile.
