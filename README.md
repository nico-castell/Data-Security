This repositoriy is a ***show*** of some programs and data security
algorithms I made. It's meant to be used in
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and on
**Linux**. However, you should me able to compile almost everything with a
few tweaks to the [config files](.vscode) on any other platforms.

## Folders

1. **[Binary](Binary)**: This folder contains a binay visualizer.
    You input some text, and it displays the binary, octal, hexadecimal, and
    decimal values of your file.
1. **[Encrypter](Encrypter)**: This folder contains a program with a simple
    XOR encryption algorithm.
1. **[Generator](Generator)**: This folder contains a simple password generator.
1. **[Obfuscator](Obfuscator)**: This folder contains an obfuscator, more
    information is available on that folder's README.

## How to use the workspace

There are some build and debug tasks already prepared, as well as a
[makefile](makefile), to quickly compile and run the different projects.

1. **Build tasks:** There are 6 build tasks prepared, 4 to compile each
    project individually, 1 to compile everything with the makefile, and 1
    to clean everything with the makefile.
1. **Debug configurations:** There are 4 debug configurations, 1 for each
    project.
